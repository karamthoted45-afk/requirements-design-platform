# Oracle Autonomous Database Performance Optimizer

This project is a Python-based SQL performance analyzer designed to simulate 
how SQL queries behave inside an Oracle Autonomous Database. It measures 
execution time, row count, and provides basic performance optimization suggestions.

## Features
- Simulates SQL query execution  
- Measures execution time  
- Returns number of rows processed  
- Suggests optimizations for slow queries  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Time module  
- Pandas module  

## How to Run
python oracle_autonomous_db_optimizer.py

## Example Output
Execution Time: 0.40s  
Rows Returned: 500  
Optimization Suggestion: Query is optimized.
